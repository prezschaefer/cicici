## Effects of Arcane objects and the Arcana upon the Brain

A study of how Arcane objects, such as enchanted helms, holy symbolic necklaces, and even pointy wizard hats affect the brain. Fear of such objects and use of the Arcana due to possible links to brain development and even tumor growth has caused a drop in attendence around the world to Arcane Academies. There has never been an official study performed, due to the fear of the findings. Previous data seemed to back this fear, and most Arcane based entities desired not to prove this possibility any further.

However, an independent study was conducted, using both live and recently dead creatures. Previous "studies" had focused merely on dead creatures, which mostly included those with dastardly actions or evil intentions. Data found during this study not only found no correlation between Arcane enchanted items and brain tumors, but found data which possibly showed that those already with brain diseases would seek Arcane powers and enchantments. Further studies could help prove there is no correlation between mental diseases and brain tumors to Arcana, but additional funding is required and would be best done by other independent parties.


## Evocation and its affect upon the Environment

The massive use of Evocation magic throughout history, especially during recent wars and battles against the evil forces seems to have affected the surronding environments. Not surprisingly, evocation magic involving fire has certainly destroyed large quantities of plant life and caused massive migrations and death of the surronding creatures dependent on said plant life. However, other evocation magic, such as those involving ice/frost, ligthning, and even radiance have also damaged the wildlife and food chain.

Surprisingly, spells which include frost and ice have killed off large quantities of plant life, nearly destroying entire biomes due to the timing of these spells. In worst cases, the frost and ice was able to kill massive collections of plants during early growth periods, effectively killing the plants immediately. While lighting is normal throughout nature, its occurrance due to evocation magic outside typical enviromental conditions has caused wildfires at irregular periods, and killed large quantities of wildlife as a result. Also, large lightning strikes utilized as part of evocation spells have killed massive amounts of fish and water life in water based environments, such as ponds, swamps, lakes, etc.

The rising amount of Arcana used throughout the world has drastically affected the environment. If regulations and other controls are not put into place, the accelerated use of such evoation magic could change the world in unknown ways and possible jepordize our ability to continue to exist in this world.
