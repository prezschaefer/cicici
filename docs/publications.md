## Effects of Arcane objects and the Arcana upon the Brain

A study of how Arcane objects, such as enchanted helms, holy symbolic necklaces, and even pointy wizard hats affect the brain. Fear of such objects and use of the Arcana due to possible links to brain development and even tumor growth has caused a drop in attendence around the world to Arcane Academies. There has never been an official study performed, due to the fear of the findings. Previous data seemed to back this fear, and most Arcane based entities desired not to prove this possibility any further.

However, an independent study was conducted, using both live and recently dead creatures. Previous "studies" had focused merely on dead creatures, which mostly included those with dastardly actions or evil intentions. Data found during this study not only found no correlation between Arcane enchanted items and brain tumors, but found data which possibly showed that those already with brain diseases would seek Arcane powers and enchantments. Further studies could help prove there is no correlation between mental diseases and brain tumors to Arcana, but additional funding is required and would be best done by other independent parties.


## Evocation and its affect upon the Environment

The massive use of Evocation magic throughout history, especially during recent wars and battles against the evil forces seems to have affected the surronding environments. Not surprisingly, evocation magic involving fire has certainly destroyed large quantities of plant life and caused massive migrations and death of the surronding creatures dependent on said plant life. However, other evocation magic, such as those involving ice/frost, ligthning, and even radiance have also damaged the wildlife and food chain.

Surprisingly, spells which include frost and ice have killed off large quantities of plant life, nearly destroying entire biomes due to the timing of these spells. In worst cases, the frost and ice was able to kill massive collections of plants during early growth periods, effectively killing the plants immediately. While lighting is normal throughout nature, its occurrance due to evocation magic outside typical enviromental conditions has caused wildfires at irregular periods, and killed large quantities of wildlife as a result. Also, large lightning strikes utilized as part of evocation spells have killed massive amounts of fish and water life in water based environments, such as ponds, swamps, lakes, etc.

The rising amount of Arcana used throughout the world has drastically affected the environment. If regulations and other controls are not put into place, the accelerated use of such evoation magic could change the world in unknown ways and possible jeopordize our ability to continue to exist in this world.


## Control and Regulations on Magically Enchanted Items

Since the discovery of magically enchanted items in the world, and the rush to create and develop new ones, fears of the unregulated acquisition of these items and their use to kill has caused some to question if additional control and regulations are required. Many believe that the unregulated creation and trade of said items has lead to the spike in deadly encounters and evil acts throughout the world. The call for addition regulation and possibly even the disarmament of this magical items from the populous has gained traction.

However, the data to show such a correlation has not been found during this study. Moreover, data seems to suggest that the popularization of such items throughout the world has helped prevent even more dangerous encounters and evil deeds. Numberous of attempted encounters and hostile actions have risen during the same amount of time since magically enchanted items became more common. It would suggest that although there is more evil in the world than in the past, there is also more good as well. Not only have more risen to power to propel evil actions and to cause death, but also has shown to raise more to defend others and help save the world around us. While more choose to participate in the fight between evil and good, it is clear that these items will play a larger role in this battle. Although said regulations and control would help reduce the number of deadly encounters, data shows it might actually increase it instead.
