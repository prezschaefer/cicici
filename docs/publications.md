## Effects of Arcane objects and the Arcana upon the Brain

A study of how Arcane objects, such as enchanted helms, holy symbolic necklaces, and even pointy wizard hats affect the brain. Fear of such objects and use of the Arcana due to possible links to brain development and even tumor growth has caused a drop in attendence around the world to Arcane Academies. There has never been an official study performed, due to the fear of the findings. Previous data seemed to back this fear, and most Arcane based entities desired not to prove this possibility any further.

However, an independent study was conducted, using both live and recently dead creatures. Previous "studies" had focused merely on dead creatures, which mostly included those with dastardly actions or evil intentions. Data found during this study not only found no correlation between Arcane enchanted items and brain tumors, but found data which possibly showed that those already with brain diseases would seek Arcane powers and enchantments. Further studies could help prove there is no correlation between mental diseases and brain tumors to Arcana, but additional funding is required and would be best done by other independent parties.


## Evocation and its affect upon the Environment

The massive use of Evocation magic throughout history, especially during recent wars and battles against the evil forces seems to have affected the surronding environments. Not surprisingly, evocation magic involving fire has certainly destroyed large quantities of plant life and caused massive migrations and death of the surronding creatures dependent on said plant life. However, other evocation magic, such as those involving ice/frost, ligthning, and even radiance have also damaged the wildlife and food chain.

Surprisingly, spells which include frost and ice have killed off large quantities of plant life, nearly destroying entire biomes due to the timing of these spells. In worst cases, the frost and ice was able to kill massive collections of plants during early growth periods, effectively killing the plants immediately. While lighting is normal throughout nature, its occurrance due to evocation magic outside typical enviromental conditions has caused wildfires at irregular periods, and killed large quantities of wildlife as a result. Also, large lightning strikes utilized as part of evocation spells have killed massive amounts of fish and water life in water based environments, such as ponds, swamps, lakes, etc.

The rising amount of Arcana used throughout the world has drastically affected the environment. If regulations and other controls are not put into place, the accelerated use of such evoation magic could change the world in unknown ways and possible jeopordize our ability to continue to exist in this world.


## Control and Regulations on Magically Enchanted Items

Since the discovery of magically enchanted items in the world, and the rush to create and develop new ones, fears of the unregulated acquisition of these items and their use to kill has caused some to question if additional control and regulations are required. Many believe that the unregulated creation and trade of said items has lead to the spike in deadly encounters and evil acts throughout the world. The call for addition regulation and possibly even the disarmament of this magical items from the populous has gained traction.

However, the data to show such a correlation has not been found during this study. Moreover, data seems to suggest that the popularization of such items throughout the world has helped prevent even more dangerous encounters and evil deeds. Numberous of attempted encounters and hostile actions have risen during the same amount of time since magically enchanted items became more common. It would suggest that although there is more evil in the world than in the past, there is also more good as well. Not only have more risen to power to propel evil actions and to cause death, but also has shown to raise more to defend others and help save the world around us. While more choose to participate in the fight between evil and good, it is clear that these items will play a larger role in this battle. Although said regulations and control would help reduce the number of deadly encounters, data shows it might actually increase it instead.


## Providing Free Arcane Education to All

Some of the citizens in the larger cities have found that many of the populous is unable to afford an education at the Arcane Academies. As such, a movement has begun to request that the local governments and leaders provide the capital for any and all who wish to attend such universities. However, the primary argument against such a mandate is raising the capital necessary for this to be achieved. Many expect the governments and leaders can easily supply this capital, which in turn will end up back in the economy when it is used by these universities.

An elaborate investigation, including some work disguised as applicants and attendees of these universities, along with attendees of gatherings by the groups pushing for free eduction was performed to try to determine the possibility of providing this kind of opportunity. During this investigation, we found evidence that would lean towards the fact that even if these Arcane Academies ended up with additional students the flow of resources back into the communities around them would be unlikely. At least, contributing back to communities at levels that those claim would occur. Surprisingly, the additional income that these academies have seen over the past few years was not redistributed back into the local community, but rather used internally within the academy or externally with entities unrelated to the local community.

Also, after spending time collecting financial and available resource data, the local governments and leaders would not be able to provdie the necessary funding for such a program. Crunching the numbers of these costs for higher learning, it would be impossible or most likely detremental to the local economy. The amounts of resources and capital necessary to provide these opportunities would most likely cause the local economies to crash, allowing for outside sources to take control. The lack of these resources could result in a mass exodus from the community, due to the lack of options, or draw in outside forces to quickly and easily take control, possibly by force.

Furthermore, the fact that there would be an increase in arcane use throughout the world could drastically affect everything. Studies are starting to show that the increasing use of arcane abilities throughout the world has affected it negatively. Providing access to these powers to any could push the scale even further over. Also, no mention of any kind of vetting or interview system has been discussed, which would most likely be necessary to prevent any students from using their new arcane abilities to enrich themselves and overthrow the established order currently in place.


## A Better Civilization Through Shared Wealth

Recent publications are begining to claim that a better life for all of civilization can be made possible by a simple distribution of wealth and resources across all aspects of the populous. A significant collection of followers have begun using these publications to base their own beliefs and expectations off of. Unfortunately, the publications that are being referenced by these groups are more opinionated than based on real data. As such, we have attempted to collect data on small pockets of shared communals and scale those results up to larger communities in order to provide at least some data.

Due to the nature of many of mankind's most basic desires, history has taught us that greed and lust typically drive many people to take from their human breathren. The previous publications mentioned believe that if we are able to supress these desires, especially in a communal setting, it would be possible to live in a society where all were equal. Thus, building a better civilization and driving humanity towards a greater future. However, suppressing one's desires can be said easier than done in the current state of civilization.

We studied twelve small communities, eight of them providing some kind of communal centralized economy or political leadership. The other six were used as a control group for comparison to determine the scaling to larger communities. While the majority of the shared communities worked well on this scale, it was determined that the effectiveness decreased drastically as the community's size increased. The smaller the community, the closer the individuals, and the more accepting of each other and their ability to share with each other. As the size of the community increased, the more unfamiliar the individuals were with each other, making it less desirable to be part of the shared community, at least from the contribution side.

Although the same desires and individualism was seen in the six non-shared systems, each individual had to contribute to the society in order to benefit from it. The same circumstances were seen on the small scale as on the larger size communities. This was is stark contrast to the communities that practiced shared resources and wealth, which as mentioned before, became less effective and desirable by the community as its size increased. Given these findings, the desire to shift to such a shared communal society could be extremely dangerous to organized civilization. This is completely contridictory to the statements and hopes that the previous publications have stated. It is best to continue to perform these studies in greater number and data analysis before the greater public becomes influenced any further.
