# Catacomb of Doors

>As Ondross passes out, Marrel and I see the ground errupt with large groups of insects and spiders, things are about to get bad.
>
>Hwon and Dwayne attempt to break open the door, locking the rest of us in this room, now filling with bugs and spiders. As it seems like things are about to end, Dwayne and Hwon break in and help the rest of us clear the room of these damn gross creepy crawlies. Thank god, as that would have been an awful way to go, to these damn little creatures swarming all over us. Yuck!

>Just as we are about to relax after crushing these damn critters, the green blob takes it chance to attack us.
>
>As Dwayne and Hwon strike at the blob, it begins to split off, multiple times. It isn't until Marrel and Ondross hit it with arrows and flame, that we find the best way to take these blobs down for good. Dwayne and I are looking extremely rough, along with some of the others, so thank goodness Ondross calls upon his sprititual elk to help cure some of our wounds.

>After a tough double fight, we clean up the green blob and move on to the next room.
>
>We continue trying to find an exit to this place. So many doors, so many dead ends it seems. Ondross attempts to scoop up some of the remaining green blob goop, but ends up burning himself as he does. We move to another room, filled with flatware, silverware, and other cooking items it seems. Most of it looks to be in poor condition, but Dwayne finds some to his liking, and promises to use it to feed us what he cooks next. My heart stops for a few seconds as I question whether I could survive such a thing, after the last meal.

>In the next room, we find a large blue marble sarcophagus and a strange statue.
>
>A very eerie feeling comes across all of us as we near the room. Something feels very off and dangerous about the room. We push past this feeling and open the sarcophagus, which appears to be empty. After taking a few minutes to help identify magical items, I find that it is not actually empty. And some kind of jewelry appears to be providing the corpse inside a cloak of invisibility. After removing the necklace, which Ondross puts on almost immediately, a dangerous path, we search the corpse to find a large key on it. This might be our jackpot.

>We use the large key to open the large chest, avoiding the traps and finding a ton of gold and some potions.
>
>We are able to open the chest safely, but the trap still appears to be set within the chest. We handle things very very carefully, removing two potions from the chest and as much gold as we can. After a few attempts to clear out what we can, Dwayne simply rushes in and scoops out the remaining gold, a bit impatient to wait for us to complete. It is getting rather late, and since we have been unable to find a way out, we decide to find a safe room and spend the night down here, trying to rest back up for our hopefully escape tomorrow.

>We wake up and continue looking through the rest of the catacombs to try to find an exit.
>
>We finish looking through the leftover rooms down here, finding nothing more of interest. However, we also don't find an exit. But, I notice a strange feeling coming from one of the dead ends of a hallway. After what seems like forever, we are able to identify a secret trigger which opens up the end of the hallway, providing yet another hallway, leading to yet another door. This one is different though, as the new door leading to some kind of study or labratory. It appears this might be our way out. However, it probably isn't empty, and we will have to tread lightly.
