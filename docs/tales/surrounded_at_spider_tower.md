# Surrounded at Spider Tower

>Dwayne lifts up the portcullis and we make our way through the gate.
>
>Dwayne and Marrel quickly prop up the portcullis with a log nearby. I supervise to make sure we have a quick escape route if necessary. We look upon the tower ahead, it stands tall, but very wide at the base as well. It is surprising we couldn't see it really until now, or that no one else has really noticed it. Probably because there are no roads or paths outside of town. Mainly because the King seems more interested in enriching himself, more so than his own people. Not surprising, given what we already know about him I suppose.

>Archimedes scouts ahead, finding large clusters of webbing and possible bodies.
>
>Archimedes is able to take a quick pass around the area, staying high and out of sight as best he can. His eyes are much more useful at range than up close. He is able to notice a number of objects wrapped in webbing. By their size and shape, they definitely appear to be that of humanoid bodies. Most likely the men that have been sent here over time, and possibly any others foolish enough to get too close. We will have to be very careful, as I hate spiders, and don't want to become their next meal.

>Dwayne cuts one wrapped body open, finding a rolled up scroll and an odd head wound.
>
>He is careful enough to preserve what is left of the body, but this one looks pretty worn from time already. The head wound may look like a simple spider bite to the common eye, but it appears to be much more than that. I make sure to quickly sketch it for study later. We cannot spend much time here, as I certainly feel like there are eyes, sets of eyes, upon us already. More interestingly, the small scroll Dwayne hands me, secured by a string and rolled up, appears to be blank. However, that peeks my interest even more. Again, another item that needs to be investigated further, but when there is more time and much less danger.

>As we start moving toward the tower, a group of wolf spiders approaches us.
>
>Just as we start making our way closer to the tower, a group of wolf spiders attacks and attempts to surround our group. We fight hard, dodge our best, and beat them back. The spiders may have had the jump on us, but luckily we are able to deal with them rather quickly. Although, Dwayne takes yet more damage, and I am afraid if we don't get time to rest, it could get worse.

>We notice more spiders approach. As we prepare for the worst, we begin to attack at long range.
>
>We retreat back, to the opposite side of a lake, attempting to take cover and prepare our next move. Marrel is sniping the spiders at range, while Dwayne, enlarged by my powers, is able to assist and also handle a couple of swarms of spiders nearby us. However, the number of spiders after us grows. They split and attack to attack us from both sides around the lake. Luckily we are able to finish off one group of them and attempt to make our way back to the gate.

>Just as we finish one set, the other splits and attempts to surround us again.
>
>We reverse direction once again, and quickly deal with this new half of spiders, while the others attack to move behind us, around the lake. We dance and dance as best we can around the lake. Trying to keep our distance from the ever growing amount of spiders. I am running low on ammunition, and soon arcane power. Fighting hand to hand may work well for Dwayne, and maybe even Marrel perhaps, but not for me. The spiders are starting to get to my head, those damn bastards. We need to find a way out of this mess.

>Even more spiders show up, and as we are about to approach the gate, a magic wielding spider attacks.
>
>As more groups of spiders start moving our way, we are able to sneak through the groups and start rushing towards the gate and protcullis. However, that is when we notice a larger spider appear waiting for us. His is able to cast a spell on us, fortunately, Marrel and I dodge out of the way. But Dwayne, Dwayne is slowed down and starts to fall behind. Things are getting bad now. The spiders are catching up to Dwayne, and if Marrel and I try to help, we will surely all die here. The spider in front of us disappears, most likely to draw us all in closer. We are running out of time. Soon we will have no options left.

>As the spiders surround us and prepare to finish us, I recall the one item that can save us.
>
>Just as we are about to be surrounded once more, this time with no lake to provide us some cover, I remember what the King gave us. If we are to survive this and make it out of here, we must use of it. The Stone Crown he gave, allowing us to quickly return back to the castle, seems to be our only way out. No other options were available to us, so thank goodness we had this with us. Perhaps next time we prepare to go out on a quest such as this, we should make sure to take inventory of our equipment, especially these magical items. But somehow or another, we are able to recall that Dwayne still carries this item and Marrel and I attempt to rush back towards Dwayne. At what seems like the last moment, as the spiders near and this magical spider prepares to strike again, Dwayne warps us back to the castle. We all take a deep breath, escaping in the last minute. However, we left our horses, tied up near the tower, and probably near hungry spiders. I don't think that will turn out well. Too bad, I know how much Androse likes talking with animals, especially those which we just recieved from Grog. Damn.
