# Hidden in Town Hall

>Our group wakes up and joins each other for breakfast, although Hwon is sleeping in yet.
>
>It's good to see everyone again in the morning, knowing they must have had fun last nite. As usual, Ondros has his loaded baked potato, which is an odd breakfast choice, but he certainly like potatoes. Dwayne orders 3 whole chickens for breakfast, surprising the waitress who has to go out to get additional chickens to meet his request. I of course am still broke, so just some water for me this morning. Hopefully that luck will change shortly.

>We find out that Vodalian has actually left in the night.
>
>It's not too surprising that he ran off, he seemed pretty intimidated by Dwayne and the rest of us. He was very kind to leave us a set of healing potions however, so there is that. Hwon does wake up in time to join us as we leave. He mentions he had some sort of dream of a dying giraffe, which makes perfect sense given the sound of Dwayne's typical morning chant ritual. Archimedes hasn't returned just yet, but he should return by tomorrow, with news of the end location, or that he had to give up early.

>We go to see the head magistrate, Yolonda at Town Hall.
>
>See provides us a nice stipend, which is great, to have some spending money again, even though it's only a few gold each. I'm guessing this won't be enough to even get into the library, but we shall see I guess. She also mentions that there could be additional work in the future, performing a number of different tasks. Something we will have to keep in mind from now on, hopefully finding a good source of challenging quests and meaningful rewards. Yolonda also mentions we should talk with the jailers in the otherside of Town Hall, about other possible tasks they have. It's very surprising how much there is to do here in this one building. Perhaps their local guards don't have any experience or desire to do their jobs and they need people like us to do them. Maybe we are just suckers who they expect will take on these dangerous and awful jobs.

>We visit with the jailers there, about possible future jobs escorting to the Arena.
>
>We talk with Jules about opportunities for reward. He mentions this escort job of people and creatures to the Arena to provide resources for their "shows". Again, these guards must just be too scared to do their job, or too lazy. You would think they could handle the simple task of moving prisoners or animals from one place to the other, but I guess not. If worst comes to worst, perhaps we can simply take over this land without a fight. I don't imagine it will take much more than a roar from Dwayne and shapechange from Ondros and all the guards will run away. Ondros did mention that the beasts they are bringing in aren't very smart, as his convorsations with them went no where. Perhaps the guards have been performing illegal experiments or other things on these animals pushing them to insanity. This town certainly has some strange things going on. Maybe we need to leave this place sooner rather than later.

>Ondros feels an odd chill and after an investigation we find a hidden stairwell.
>
>We find a very very old storeroom in Town Hall, for some reason which no one has used for quite some time. It seems like once again, the local government has a stash of supplies and other items that don't get used and is hording. Who knows how long these goods have been here and why they haven't seen use recently. Not even a standard inventory has been done in this room for quite some time. It worries me that if there are any perishable goods, or other similar items, they would be long useless by now and wasted. More useless government spending at its finest.

>Run into a series of undead creatures in this underground passageways.
>
>As we explore this hidden set of passageways under the Town Hall, we run into ghouls, ghosts, and zombies. Surprising that they have gone unnoticed right underneath Town Hall all this time. We fight our way through the few rooms here, finding all sorts of empty crates and missing supplies, but mostly undead. Lucky for me, most of the fighting happens at a distance, but at least I'm able to add a few helping actions to the group. I haven't found my calling yet in battle, I'm certainly interested in helping my new friends, but combat still seems a bit too much for me to handle. I need to find a way to continue to help my friends when we get into trouble and overcome this fear, but also keep myself alive.

>Find a Cloak of Protection on a guard down here, providing it to Dwayne to use.
>
>We just happened to find this nice cloak on a dead guard down here. For his rank, this seemed a bit odd, so we figured it must be important. When the party decided to take a quick rest, I figured I'd at least take this time to study the cloak further. It was certainly worth the time, as I was able to determine it was a Cloak of Protection from my studies. My goodness, what luck we got with this item. According to my studies, this cloak can help protect someone from all sorts of things, especially helping with magical effects and attacks. Dwayne requested to use it and after giving it a bit of thought, he probably was the best to have it, at least for now. So, I told him he could certainly wear it as it would help him, but he'd need to spend some more time getting used to its abilities.

>We also find a note from Lt. Vestron possibly to the King about recruiting an army of undead.
>
>After battling of the undead creatures throughout these passages, we seach each room for any other interesting items. We find this note from one of the guard officers mentioning a count of bodies and dead from nearby cemetaries and other areas. It seems as though this officer was collecting bodies for a "Sire", the King possibly. The note also mentions using these bodies in some kind of ceremonies in which they hope to use the results in overthrowing the accursed tower. I assume this tower is the one that the King mentioned east of town, but that is certainly an assumption. All of this is starting to grow darker and deeper, but is making for one hell of a mystery. Perhaps this is worth unraveling a bit futher. Maybe we can find out a little bit more of what this passageway could be leftover from (an older building prior to the Town Hall) at the library. Just one more good excuse to go to the library!
