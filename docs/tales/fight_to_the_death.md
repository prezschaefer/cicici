# Fight to the Death?

>After I finish talking with Corporal Samson, I catch up with the party on their way back to town.
>
>Everyone is still a bit worked up from the last encounter. Things certainly went poorly between us and the guards. They got even worse when the hyenas escaped and starting attacking everyone. And then of course it didn't help that Marrel and Dwayne entered the security shack and barred the door. The Corporal was certainly not too keen on that. However, I think I was able to point out the confusion and anger on both sides and salvaged what I could from the encounter. As such, the Corporal mentioned we should stop by the arena on our way back to town to pick up an additional payment for our work and help.

>I told everyone we should stop at the arena to pick up a possible bonus payment for our hard work, from Steve there.
>
>Everyone seemed excited to possibly recoup the difference of what was originally promised. I did have to spend a little time talking Dwayne, and probably whoever else was on a potent rampage, that we could do this and ideally forget about James, who mislead us on the job's payment. Luckily, I think I am able to reason with him and convince him that his pursuit is folly. As such, we all enter the arena area and make our way in to see the game master and find this Steve for payment.

>Parkus, the game master, points us over to Steve, the goliath arena master. He and Dwayne seem to know each other.
>
>To everyone's surprise, Steve was from the same goliath clan as Dwayne. It isn't often we run into goliaths, but this one just happened to know Dwayne. However, this Steve the Stone Cold was certainly not a big fan of Dwayne. He was extremely hostile toward Dwayne and disagreed with Dwayne's position and future opportunity to leave their clan. The insults didn't stop, and I fear that the remaining emotions from the last encounter we had south of the arena didn't help matters. In the end, it was decided that the two would fight and Dwayne would attempt to show he was truly the next leader.

>While Dwayne went off to prepare for the fight, the rest of us got ourselves some roasted peanuts to eat while we watched the battle.
>
>We also are met by Darkus, who was sent off by Steve to collect the remaining of our payment, giving us a sack of gold. The crowd is pretty stoked for the upcoming fight. It seems like this Steve has some renown for his skills here in the past. This of course makes me worry a bit. However, Dwayne is usually good at sizing people up and knowing when he can take someone or at least live up to the challenge. I figure we should try to stoke up Dwayne regardless, and use some of my arcane powers to make the crowd appear even louder as they chant his name. Even more amazing, Hwon uses his new learning and assists as well. Hwon also uses his new arcane powers to message Dwayne directly, mentioning we still have yet to be paid our full promise, or something like that, as I was not part of the shared messaging.

>The fight begins, and it seems like each side is landing blows against each other, but we can't tell who yet is winning, but that doesn't last long.
>
>Dwayne is getting some good hits in on Steve, and is able shrug off most of Steve's retaliations. However, Steve is certainly more agile and trained that one would think. He is able to chain multiple attacks together and make quick strike after quick strike. Although Dwayne is able to return a blow here or there, it seems like the hits he is taking are adding up quickly. With few options available to help, we try to come up with something to make sure Dwayne isn't outright killed in the fight, a normal result.

>As the fight begins to turn against Dwayne, Ondross assumes his rat form and Hwon lowers him down to the arena floor, to help if necessary.
>
>The entire crowd watches as the battle continues, and just when it looks like Dwayne is going to be taken out, Steve stops, and simply knocks Dwayne unconcious. Ondross is able to notice this, but to the rest of us, we worry that perhaps Dwayne did just die. As the fight ends, two workers drag Dwayne out of the arena grounds while the rest of us try to make our way to him. I'm not sure what has really happened and I'm concerned Dwayne is being taken somewhere to prepare him for burial or worse, assuming he is already dead.

>We find Dwayne is okay, and after a little persuasion, Ondross heals Dwayne to return him to conciousness.
>
>Dwayne is even madder than he was before, which is extremely bad, but we return to the rental cart and leave to return back to town. Dwayne says little on our journey back to town, and we all assume he is simply stewing on the inside. I fear that this may lead to more trouble if he is unable to control his anger and may try to return to fight Steve again, without being properly prepared. Next time, could be his last time. I'll have to make sure to keep his anger at bay as best as I can, and hopefully the rest of us can help him improve his skills, so he is ready next time.

>We return the cart back to Jimmy's General Store and grab ourselves some lunch back at Grog's Grog.
>
>By some fortunate miscalculation, Jimmy returns our entire deposit for the cart rental. However, rather than keep it all and not pay anything for the rental, I give him 5 gp back, thanking him for his help. More than likely, this gesture will provide us a little more oil in the bartering gears in the future. We all take an hour to eat and get our strength back during lunch, after the mess of things back around the arena. For once, Grog is actually around and free to talk. So, Marrel approaches him and asks him about any news he has or possible help he might need. I sent Hwon upstairs to count the gold we received from the arena, and after quite a while he finally returns with the count. I'm not sure why it took him so long, I was in near constant communication with him to try to help things go by faster, but it still took him a while. Maybe I'll need to help him count next time and review his process as he does, providing ideas and improvements as he goes to improve his methods.

>Grog mentions a goblin, Skunky, who has been causing him trouble and asks if we can "take care" of him.
>
>While Marrel collects more information on this Skunky character, I notice a man that has been watching us. As he leaves the tavern, Hwon and Archimedes trail him to the nearby brothel. The rest of us try to catch up, but Hwon enters the brothel and attempts to follow this man further. Although we typically try to stay in contact with each other, using his new arcane abilities, I loose contact with him. This is highly abnormal, as we know that communication can mean life and death if we aren't careful. And unless he is already in trouble, he would at least provide us some kind of warning or message, but nothing comes.

>The rest of us enter the brothel looking for Hwon, and after being harassed by the man at front desk, Ondross is able to guide us to Hwon via smell.
>
>We move through the brothel, to the second floor and make our way closer to Hwon. However, we enter a room to find Hwon is knocked out and tied up to a chair. The group of men around him do not seem to be something Hwon would've paid for, so even though this is a brothel, something is certainly off. Before we are able to act, Marcus and another group of men show up behind us, encircling us.

>Marcus has surrounded us and now demands we return his drugs to him or Hwon will die.
>
>It turns out the smurf powder we found was Marcus' and he has found it missing. Marcus is extremely upset and threatens us with extreme violence. Just as things seem to being headed down the wrong road once again, toward hostilities, Marrel pipes up. I like his thought of trying to play off the drugs and how we could even be possibly involved, but his approach seems poorly choosen. However, even though I feel like he is giving off a number of tells, Marcus doesn't seem to notice, more focused on intimidating us than reading us. After a little more persuasion and deception, Marcus believes our story that we had nothing to do with the disappearance of his goods. We tell him we will keep an eye out for him and lucky for us, he pays us what he promised. Well, supposedly what he promised, as we have yet to count out his payment.
