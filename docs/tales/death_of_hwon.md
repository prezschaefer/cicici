# Death of Hwon

>I return to the library and find an interesting book in the secret room.
>
>Hwon points out an old tome inside the secret room. It has what appears to be ancient map in the front. It's going to require a great deal of study, but by first appearance, it seems like the city of Bywater was next to an ancient lake, along with another town, across the lake on the east side. It appears to be south of the current orc camp east of town.

>After visiting the library, I return back to the inn, to review the books we collected from the underground labratory, some interesting reads.
>
>One book contains a very detailed set of information about battlefield medicine. Primarily how to treat wounds and identify plants and even poisons and afflictions on the battlefield in a quick process. Perhaps this information will be of help to Marrel, as the contents of plants and wildlife useful in treatments seems to be something he would be interested in.

>We wait for it to get late before heading over to Newt's Landing, where we expect Skunky to show.
>
>Dwayne heads to Chef Randy's rather than waiting, he is a bit impatient, and is more interested in cooking than talking and reading. What a terrible thing, to be interested in Randy's lifestyle. I must find a way to prevent him from influencing any others and spoiling the entire world with terrible food. I'll have to try to use Dwayne's job to collect more information about Randy and how we can possible save the world from him. Hwon runs down into the catacombs under City Hall, collecting a sample of the "Beast" to plant on Skunky, but he informs me he stashed 200 gp of his under some clothes there as well. He was afraid to carry such a large amount of gold on himself. Good point, and I wouldn't mentioned how I handle such things, but it's best I keep that a secret I think.

>We arrive at Newt's Landing, and Andross makes a fool of himself infront of the owner, Olif. Hwon saves face for our party, and gets drinks.
>
>Typical Andross, he isn't that charming, but it seems like he rubs the owner the wrong way. You can just about hear the owner, Olif, shouting at Andross, as he tries to make an order and have pleasant conversation. Just when it is about to errupt, Hwon manages to save the day. Ordering our table a round of drinks and getting on Olif's good side.

>While waiting for Skunky, we notice a male dwarf bring in a platter of what Andross calls "spicy potatoes", only to find out it is simply rat poison.
>
>Good thing we didn't follow up on Andross and attempt to eat those potatoes. It would've been a bad time for everyone, perhaps not Andross or Dwayne though, as their tastes seem to be significantly lower than most. Hwon learns from Olif that there are giant rats in his cellar. He has been trying to kill them for some time, hence the rat poison. He offers Hwon 300 gp if we can clear his cellar of the rats, given nothing else has worked. However, he requests we do such a thing after hours, say 2 AM or so. I'm not sure why, as it seems like everyone already knows about them and it's not worth hiding.

>Marrel casually attempts to look for Skunky, who immediately takes notice and seems to be alerted that we are here for him.
>
>Hwon figures perhaps we can get a better view if he goes out the back to the bathroom. He gets up and makes his way to the back door. Skunky seems to follow suit, but makes his way to the back first. Marrel makes his way out the front, but rushes around back to get a side view of Hwon and Skunky. After Hwon fails to respond to my requests of an update via silent message, I get nervous. I hear back from Marrel that they are not out behind the bar and I decide we had better go in and check on Hwon.

>We see two orcs move in after Hwon. Andross and I make our way to the back door, as I tell Marrel to circle back and join us.
>
>As Andross and I move through the back door, it appears it isn't an exit, but rather a back room. We find Hwon held by the two orcs, being robbed by Skunky. Just as we are about to try to exit this escalating situation, two more orcs enter the room and Skunky declares we all must surrender our gold. Such things by terrible people just cannot occur. I threaten him to leave us be, let us go and return all of our gold. As he refuses, one of the orcs holding Hwon, pulls out an axe and strikes Hwon.

>We enter battle with Skunky and his 6 orc bodyguards. Four inside the back room with Andross, Hwon, and I. The other two outside holding off Marrel.
>
>Hwon is surrounded and chased down to the back of the room. As Andross and I try to hold off Skunky and the remaining orcs. I am able to create a giant web at the door, to prevent the other two orcs from entering, hoping to gods that Marrel can hold his own out there. Andross transforms into a giant spider, taking great advantage of my web. However, Hwon is forced into a corner by Skunky and one of his orcs, attempting to dodge the attacks. I try to move through the cramped room, pushing off an orc with a jolt of lightning when possible. Hwon falls once, but is able to catch himself and get back to his feet. However, Skunky takes advantage of this, and strikes him down a second time. I have to get over to him, as Andross is still attacking some of the orcs as a spider. Marrel must still be fighting outside the room. But, I can't make it to him in time, even after striking Skunky with lightning, stopping his heart immediately.

>Hwon lies on the floor; dead.
>
>I just couldn't make it to him. The orcs boxed me out and I wasn't able to get to Hwon in time. I see him cough on his own blood, just feet away from me. When the last orc falls, I try to rush to Hwon, and force a healing potion down his throat. But it does nothing. He doesn't respond. He is dead. Hwon is dead... He's gone... I couldn't save him... I... ... I....
