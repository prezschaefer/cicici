# Bywater First Sights

```
Just as we entered the city, the guard was all to happy to see us.
He handed us a map and we could certainly tell he was looking for new friends.
I'm not sure if he was trying to show off or not, but he named literally every building in town.
```


```
We decided to checkout possible work at the blacksmith's.
I was happy to hear it was Mertin's Smithing. A place I read about.
He was recently famous for this amazing pair of gauntlets he made for an adventurer.
The way he constructed the knuckles and small joints allowing movement was beyond impressive.
It seemed as he must have shrunk himself down, or made the gauntlets enormous before shrinking them.
The minute details are just amazing for someone of this plane, perhaps he isn't...
```


```
On our way, a young lad, Timmy, approached us crying, his dog stuck in a well.
I tried to cheer him up by creating an image of pastries and cookies.
I even tried to create an image of a smiling bird, with teeth.
Yet he was still unimpressed, children these days. So desensitized.
If it doesn't involve a stick and a hoop rolling in a field, they aren't interested.
```


```
Timmy lead us to the well. We explained to Timmy we'd lower him down to help the dog up.
However, I found it very inefficient to send Timmy down simply to place the dog in.
I figured we could simply fill the well with water, to raise the dog up.
Of course then it might be possible that the dog would drown.
Perhaps we could use dirt to fill it up then, but maybe the dog would get buried.
Sand perhaps sounded like a better solution.
I could tell we were going down the right road, as I saw Ondros was nodding in agreement.
He usually agrees with my methods, knowing that I'm right with all his personal book knowledge.
Maybe we could dig down next to the well, creating a path up that way.
```


```
It seemed as normal, Dwayne was in a hurry and had already got the dog and Timmy out.
He always seems like he has something to do and isn't interested in thinking.
Well, that can be said about most people I guess, acting without thinking it through.
Even Ondros is guilty of this from time to time, just taking the easy way out.
I sometimes question myself as whether I should force the group to read every night.
It could perhaps help them better understand the world and come to the same solutions as I.
```


```
As we continued our way to Mertin's, we found two thugs robbing a young woman.
We certainly had to scare them off, but how without harming the woman.
Perhaps we could create a giant image of a terrifying monster to scare them.
Well, no, I don't quite have that ability yet, even though I have read about it.
Maybe we could employ the help of the garrison and surround them.
Not enough time, they may make off before we are able to get back.
```


```
While Hwon and I were talking, Ondros and Dwayne rushed in to help the woman.
It was certainly brash to do so without a proper plan in order.
I was surprised Ondros would rush off while we were discussing our plans.
But he does act a bit reckless sometimes, running into trouble.
But we certainly do need to move ahead sometimes, so perhaps it was for the better.
```


```
I cast sleep on the thugs, twice, as they ran away. Ondros and Dwayne able to capture one of them.
They retreated immediately after I first put them to sleep, so cowardly.
Criminals these days just have no respect for law and order.
Going around and robbing people in daylight, a helpless woman for that matter.
Lucky for that one, to escape from the grips of Dwayne. Lucky the other asleep too.
Of course now we had a passed out theif to deal with.
We certainly couldn't take him with us to Mertin's as well.
```


```
We took the theif to the nearby guards, while Hwon made sure the lady got home okay.
The guards knew this criminal immediately. Not surprising, he had some pretty prominate facial features.
The guards didn't seem very interested in finding out more information however.
I was surprised at this, why wouldn't they be interested in learning more about this man and his friend.
Perhaps they had more pressing matters to deal with instead.
We were new to town, so we really hadn't heard of any recent news.
That first guard was just more interested in talking about buildings than news.
I think he wanted to be an architect more so than a guard.
```


```
We all met back up at Mertin's, shortly learning that he had lost his son to goblins.
Now this was certainly a scary thought. A young boy kidnapped by goblins.
It was only just south of town in the fields. Surely the guards would protect that area.
Then we found that it wasn't surprising that goblins were around.
Some people even knew where the goblins were hiding.
What would prevent the local garrison from going out to clear them out.
They couldn't be afraid of a few goblins nearby.
Maybe the goblins had made demands for the boy's return.
Some sort of ransom could have been made, that surely could prevent an incursion.
Very strange this all was it seems. I would've thought the King would send out an attack.
I guess he must be busy with all other city matters.
```


```
We then decided it was time to head to Grog's grog for more info and a drink and a bed.
I was really burnt out. I had spent all my energy against those thugs.
I think Dwayne was more interested in heading to the brothel we walked past.
He does tend to enjoy them from time to time. I guess most men do.
I simply don't find the time to go there. Too many books to read.
Of course I didn't have any new books on me at the moment.
I should really go check out the King's Library in town.
Open to the public that guard mentioned. I wonder if he goes there.
Perhaps he goes to read up on the local buildings and building codes.
That must be how he know so much. He has to be interested in architecture.
