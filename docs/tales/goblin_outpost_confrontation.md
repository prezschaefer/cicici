# Goblin Outpost Confrontation

>We capture one of the goblins alive and Dwayne securely ties him up.
>
>Dwayne proceeds to interrogate him by hoisting him up into the air by the scruff of his neck. After some intimidating threats and a knife to the goblin's throat, it wets its pants, or whatever you would call that clothing. Dwayne certainly has a way with people; perhaps not the most diplomatic way, but a way indeed. However, the goblin does spill the beans for the most part, for what we wish to believe.

>Archimedes spots someone trying to sneak up on us while we talk with the goblin.
>
>As we interrogate the goblin, where I use interrogate loosely, my owl catches someone trying to sneak up on us. I quickly tell the rest of the group and Hwon immediately decides to rush out and try to then sneak up on this mysterious figure. Using Archimedes eyes and my instant messaging to Hwon, I guide him in behind this figure. He sneaks up and attempts to steal the dagger handing from their belt.

>Hwon is able to sneak up on this mysterious figure and finds out he is an ally.
>
>Hwon meets Kevin, a local farmer who has been terrorized on multiple occasions by the goblins in this area. He has noticed our travel and heard the battle we just had against the goblins. He was attempting to sneak up to determine who survived the battle, hoping we had won, but having experienced the goblins so much, he was totally unsure what the outcome would be. Lucky for us and most likely him as well, we came out on top, without any losses.

>We find out Kevin, a ranger, wants to help us attack the goblin outpost nearby.
>
>After a short discussion with Kevin, his life, and how much he hates these damn goblins, he wishes to join us. We simply explain we are hoping to sneak into their territory and find out what we can about the blacksmith's, Mertin, dead son, and he wants to help. His family and belongings had also been ravaged by the goblins. His abilities provided a great boost and we were certainly happy to have his help, even if it would only be for a short time.

>We find a guard tower with two goblins, and two wolves, near an orchard.
>
>As we carefully move further into goblin territory, Archimedes spots a guard tower ahead, with an orchard about 100 feet away. We plan to move in a bit closer, to get a better view, and use the orchard for cover. We discuss the best way to neutralize the guard tower, or possibly bypass it completely. The best option of course is to take out the goblins and wolves from the tower to prevent them from seeing us or worse, sneaking up on us. While we plan out our attack, Ondros comes up with a wild idea.

>Archimedes carries the rat form of Ondros near the tower, who then proceeds to ignite it, burning it down.
>
>Ondros asks for my owl to sneak him in, in the form of a rat, so he can then return to his true form and start the ladder up into the tower on fire. As this happens, Ondros returns to rat form and Archimedes flies him back to us, out of danger. The tower continues to catch fire and the goblins inside it burn up. However, rather than staying to finish everything off, we move on, worried that we will now have little time before the other goblins realize what is happening.

>We regroup as we approach the nearby manor, currently occupied by the goblins.
>
>As we move past the tower and the orchard, Archimedes brings Ondros back to our group. While Ondros hangs out on my shoulder, still as a rat, Archimedes scouts further ahead. He spots a manor nearby, which looks like it has long been abondanded by the owners. Archimedes makes a very simple quick pass to identify the entrances and any movement around it before returning. We again discuss our next steps of how to quietly enter and clear out the manor. Figuring I should get everyone's opinion, I message Ondros, still in rat form and he offers to scout the building as a rat.

>Ondros sneaks into the manor, as a rat, and maps out the multi-story home.
>
>Archimedes drops Ondros off near the cellar door and then circles the manor, waiting for him to exit so they can return to the party, providing the details on the manor's interior. During this time, the party continues discussing what we need to do and simply waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Ondros gets himself stuck downstairs, having issues trying to climb up to the next level of the manor. However, after a long period of time, Ondros is seen exiting the manor and Archimedes grabs him and returns to the party. Ondros finally returns to his normal form and provides us details on what to find inside.

>As we approach the manor to sneak in and decimate the goblins, one of them lets out a loud battle cry.
>
>We have found out that a group of goblins are sleeping downstairs, making them our first target. However, Dwayne is uninterested in attacking defenseless and wishes instead to attack the remaining goblins awake and on guard. But none of that mattered in the end, as we were attempting to sneak up upon the manor, one of the goblins on watch spotted us and an alert was raised. By alert, it was more like a battle cry, but it certainly was effective in alerting all the goblins in the manor as they rushed out into battle.

>We engage the goblins pouring out of the manor and attacking us; a fierce battle ensues.
>
>All of the goblins Ondros spotted during his recon mission come rushing out of the manor, well all but one. One stays in the upper floor firing arrows at us as we approach the manor. The rest set upon us, many of them surprised by our numbers and basically ineffective in immediate battle. Dwayne rushes up to the front door of the manor just as the goblin leader finishes off some kind of magical potion, appearing to bulk him up. It looks like one hell of a fight, if not for the rest of the ongoing madness.

>The wolves left at the guard post show up and attack us from the rear.
>
>After a brilliant move of putting a group of three goblins to sleep at the back of the manor, the party focuses on the goblin on the second story and the leader. Just as we dispatch them, with realitive ease I'd say, I hear something approaching from behind. The wolves, we left at the guard tower have made their way free. We really should've taken a bit longer to plan that path out and make sure to clean things up properly rather than just rushing like we have been. Brash moves can certainly be effective, but they can also come back to bite you. Quite literally in this case, as the wolves attacked me, thanks goodness for my new magical understanding allowing me to protect myself. While Kevin and Hwon mop up the sleeping goblins, basically slicing them apart while they sleep, Ondros and Dwayne rush over to help me as the wolves attack. Lucky for me, my quick draw on the bow manages to take them down before they take me down, but just barely, just barely.

>We search the goblins, and the home, for any precious items, finding quite a bit of loot.
>
>There isn't much time it seems. We try to rush through the home, and the bodies, for anything helpful and interesting. I decide it is probably best to ritually search for magical enchantments and essences in the area, while the rest of the party makes the thorough search. Not only do we find quite a large amount of coins and some amazingly cut zircons, but we stumble upon what looks like a set of smithing tools. Of course it has the name Mertin Jr. embroidered on it, making it significantly easy to tell who's they were. Once I had finished my ritual, I am able to find even more interesting items on the bodies and in the manor. In all, I find a series of magical potions, a majority most likely health potions, but one very similar to the potion the leader downed and probably a strength enhancing potion. However, I am able to find a necklace or pendant on the leader which is also magical, although I cannot determine what it is just yet. More studying to do, but that will have to wait until we are out of danger.
