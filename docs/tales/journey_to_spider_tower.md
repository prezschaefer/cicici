# Journey to Spider Tower

>There's nothing we can do for Hwon, but complete the mission we came here for.
>
>We regroup after the battle, Marrel enters and helps collect what we can from Hwon and Skunky. I find a key on Skunky, unsure what it is for, but I know it must certainly be important. Marrel grabs the drugs off of Hwon's body, and we quickly plant it on Skunky. As Andross and Mareel continue to go through things and finish setting up the scene, I leave to talk with Olif.

>Dwayne arrives just in time for us to finish our work, and I talk to Olif about what happened and to call the guards to explain the fight.
>
>Dwayne plays his flute in honor of Hwon, but thank the Deep Sashelas god Hwon can't hit it. It certainly strains the ears, but no one complains given the moment. It sounds like everyone is glad to hear that Skunky got what was coming to him. With luck, the guard finds the planted drugs on Skunky, and isn't surprised given how shady he was. After providing a general report of what occurred, and signing an official statement (after being promised I can collect a copy at Town Hall a few days later), we are able to collect Hwon's body for burial.

>Sergant Gregory mentions we can ask Groundskeeper Willie near the graveyard to help with the burial, so we head that way.
>
>I have the Sergant provide us an official note of Hwon's death and body and we head to Willie's. We run into a guard, who upon checking our paperwork, wishes us well and his sorrow for our friend. We arrive at Willie's to find he doesn't appear to be home. As we contiplate what to do, a group passes by us, one of them looks familiar.

>Voldalian walks past, with a group of four others. Dwayne calls out to him, getting his attention.
>
>Voldalian mentions he is part of the Scarlet Crusaders, this group. His friends, Cruniac a burly man with sword and shield, Rivana (Shiver) a woman in robes, Shela a woman wearing leather armor, and Damas a large man in heavy plate armor. He mentions that people are unhappy with the peace with the goblins and the orcs. He also mentions a nest of kobolds south of town has caused them trouble.

>Voldalian mentions he can help put Hwon to rest at the temple in town. We follow and proceed to put Hwon to rest.
>
>Shela molds the earth to open a grave for Hwon. Voldalian talks about Hwon, and asks for him to find eternal rest. Dwayne takes the magic boots off of Hwon. A monk brings out a set of white robes to dress Hwon in as we put him to rest. I hand the monk 50 gp for his help and as a donation to the temple for allows us to put Hwon to rest.

>We return to Grog's Grog and tell him about Skunky's end, he is overjoyed to hear Skunky has finally gotten his.
>
>He tells us that our rooms and board are now covered for taking care of this matter. He also mentions that the horses he has nearby will also be available to us. We get a good rest, talk about Hwon and how much we will miss him. We all have a few drinks in his memory, but after such a long night, we all retire for the night.

>The next morning we collect some horses, have some breakfast, pick up some supplies and rations, and set out east toward Spider Tower.
>
>Dwayne finds a larger horse to carry him, called Regie, while Marrel picks out Mikie 2, and I grab a fine horse name Saddlebag. The lack of roads and maintenance seem to be from a King unwilling to invest in infrastructure. Once again, the King seems to be interested in things not helpful to the kingdom. Perhaps another sign of poor management and incompetence, maybe even some corruption as well. What a King indeed.

>We continue east and Archimedes spots a small patch of forest near a gate south of the tower. Near the forest he spots some giant spiders.
>
>The party decides we will have to go through the spiders to get to this gate and continue to the tower. Marrel leads the attack with his longbow at extreme range. Dwayne charges in to take the spiders on at close range. I try to assist, while keeping out of the direct action. The fight goes extremely poorly for Dwayne, and Marrel struggles to strike the spiders, dodging out of the way. I'm able to keep the spider following me at bay, while assisting Dwayne by enlarging him and his weapon for greater damage to the spiders. After a hard fought battle, we make our way past the forest to arrive near the gate. Ready for our next test.
