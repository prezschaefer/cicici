# Exit the Catacombs

>Having found a large cavern behind a secret door, Hwon hears a series of growling, which Andross identifies as a zombie...maybe?
>
>I send in Archimedes to perch on the doorway and try to get a better look. He identifies a number of zombies, a few corpses appear to be strapped down on tables, and a lurking figure stands in the back of the room. Archimedes cannot get a better look, but it appears larger and armored. We discuss options of how to handle what appears to be an upcoming battle. It seems this time they have the numbers, so we'll have to be even more careful. As we prepare to make a move, I provide Dwayne a protection spell against these undead creatures.

>We enter the room swiftly and attempt to clear out the zombies as the large armored figure approaches us.
>
>Marrel, Hwon, Dwayne, and I enter the room with our bows drawn and begin targeting the zombies down as quickly as possible. As the armored creature approaches, Dwayne and Andross rush it to engage. Marrel, Hwon, and I attempt to continue clearing out the zombies, while the armored creature is distracted by Andross and Dwayne. Andross attempts multiple times to transform into a large badger, but the creature focuses on Andross and wears him down each time. However, as Marrel and I attack at range, and Dwayne and Andross attack up close, supported by Hwon sneaking attacks in, we clear the room of danger.

>After the battle, we investigate the room to find it is an abondonded laboratory, with a series of amazing finds.
>
>We are able to find a cart load of interesting items in this laboratory. A note appears to mention this room was being used to construct an undead army to attack the Spider Tower we have heard so much about. However, it mentions leaving this laboratory in favor of a larging one. I find what appears to be a magical collar on one of the tables, which seems it could drastically improve Andross's intelligence, which I then give to him. Marrel finds a beautiful wooden rod of sorts, ideal for a long bow. I am able to identify that is indeed has magical properties and could suffice in a magnificent weapon. We also find a doorway, controlled by a lever, which could possibly lead us out. The best find however, is a small library of 15 books, which with Andross and Dwayne's help, I hope to return to the surface to investigate further. We make our way through the doorway, to find a stairway leading back to the surface.

>While leaving the graveyard finally, to get ourselves a hot meal, we find the grieving widow, this time with a man.
>
>This time we leave the two alone, but as I am interested in knowing more, I send Archimedes to get a better look. As I do, I notice that this man is none other than Jules, the guard that promised and tricked us, leading to a near catastrophe at the Arena. I decide I should take the opportunity to sketch these two, as I feel like we are going to run into one or both of them again. And knowing some of the party members, it probably won't go well. So, I figure I better keep to myself on this as we continue back to Grog's Grog for a hot meal and nice rest to plan our next task.

>We visit Mertin's Smithy about some possible tasks, but he sends us to Asaris on the other side of town.
>
>We stop to see if Mertin can help out a few of us, Dwayne ordering a chestplate, while Hwon is hoping to find a brass brazier for his new ritual. Marrel hopes to find someone able to carve a longbow out of his possibly enchanted wooden rod. Mertin is happy to help us best he can, but he mentions we should visit Asaris on the other side of town to handle the rest of our requests. After a few additional details, we thank him and make our way across town to see this Asaris. She is happy to help us, providing Hwon what he needs to peform his ritual, and creating a longbow for Marrel, with a significant discount.

>Hwon and I stay as he attempts to cast his new ritual, while the rest head over to Chef Randy's.
>
>Hwon and I spend time discussing the ritual his is about to attempt, he has many questions as a good apprentice should. As we finalize the details of this ritual, I provide him direction and recommendations on what kind of familiar he could benefit from. The rest of the party mentions they are headed over to Chef Randy's for a bite. This reminds me that I have one of Randy's cookbooks and I have to determine what to do with it. I could simply destroy it, but I feel like until I know more about it and the possibility of there being more throughout the world, I should wait. I may be able to use this copy to find any others, and possibly with further investigation, I could find when and where it was created. All of this information could provide me the means to save the world from terrible food. A mission which requires the utmost importance. Otherwise, the party leaves for that, and I watch Hwon proceed through his ritual, summoning a familiar raven to pair with Archimedes.
