## Illegal Library Checkout

>We sneaked back out of the underground passageways.
>
>As we make our way back to ground level, and the storage room with the hidden door, we figure we should try to remain quiet. It is highly likely we were not intended to find this hidden area, or even be snooping like we had been. It would probably be best if we carefully made our way back to the main lobby of the Town Hall and leave without anyone seeing us. That was the plan at least, as Hwon made his way just out the door, checking if anyone was coming, Dwayne simply burst out and started walking. It was very concerning that he would put us in such danger like that. He is impatient at times, and certainly times like this could cause us significant issues, if things went wrong. Luckily, no one was around this time, so we were able to make it out safely.

>It was lunch time, so we made our way back to Grog's Grog
>
>After a good mornings work of clearing out some undead and such from an unknown underground passageway, we needed some food. Dwayne ordered himself 3 more chickens to curb his hunger, while Ondros got himself some corn and other vegetables. I heard about the "Chef's Special" and figured I better give that a try. However, when my food arrived, it was tasty, but the texture and the presentation of the meal was extremely poor. Had the flavor not been so good, I wouldn't have even tried to eat it, it looked so terrible. The barmaid did offer some information about a great chef working on the otherside of town, Chef Randy, which would be worth trying. Next time, for sure.

>A rude patron, Marcus, overhears us talking and asks us to help reclaim a cave from madmen.
>
>He was clearly drinking heavily, probably drunk, and it was barely noon. It was obvious that there was something going on with this man. Of course, listening in on our conversation and then interjecting was extremely rude. His request to remove these so called "madmen" was odd as well. It almost seemed as though he wished us to solve a dispute of his with another clan. We certainly had more questions and doubts than he had answers. But, we took note of it for something possible later. We also found out he was a bit sketchy according to the barmaid.

>Finally it was time to checkout the King's Library.
>
>We had made plans during lunch to go out and investigate the goblin threat down south, but figured that it would be best to go in the morning. So, to kill the afternoon, I talked the rest of the party into checking out the library. We first stopped at the "Exotic Goods" shop, to visit the old lady we had rescued the other night. She offered a discount on our first health potion, but she did have a few other items that could be interesting, once we have the gold to pay for them. It's most likely going to be worth returning when we have some coin to spend.

>Get harassed by the librarian, even though we were being polite.
>
>Finally, I get to see this grand library. We enter the library to find quite an odd librarian working hard. To be honest, most librarians, including myself are odd. So, that's really not that surprising I guess. Perhaps I shouldn't judge another librarian like others judge me. However, he is pretty odd. He is definitely not interested in talking or socializing and usually I am not super charismatic. But I do like to talk with certain people and have deep thought provoking discussions. This Thew, the librarian, was certainly not interested in any of that. Hwon tried to distract him while the rest of us took a look around for information, but he dismissed Hwon immediately.

>While looking for some books about the surrounding towns and graveyards we find a hidden door.
>
>I figured if we could find some information on the graveyards in the surronding area by looking at some of these books in the local library. There's bound to be some helpful information about the local area and the businesses and other history of the nearby towns. It was also recommended that we try to find out more about this guard who had been collecting bodies. So, we tried to see what we could find on the local history and economic data. It did take a bit to find the right shelves for this kindd of data, as the librarian was very unhelpful and of course had very poor organizational skills in regard to the books and their topics. However, during our thorough search, we spotted a hidden door within one of the bookshelves.

>Inside we find a stash of very well kept and probably important books.
>
>What luck we have to find this hidden room! These books must be the best having been hidden away from the public. If only we had enough time to go through each and every one of these. Lucky for us, Hwon is continuing to distract and annoy the librarian while we sort through the stacks of books. Ondros simply asks me to find a really good picture book, but I simply cannot focus. Hwon rejoins us after sufficiently upsetting the librarian, and he finds a book on the shelf that catches his eye.

>Hwon attempts to free a trapped book, named Blazing Inferno.
>
>Hwon while searching the hidden room finds a book trapped with a wire going behind the bookshelf or into the wall. He spends quite a while trying to prey the wire and cut the wire to free the book of the trap. However, he just can't seem to free it. Shortly after giving up on trying to free what looks like a dangerous trap, Hown points out a well binded and covered book. As he investigates its pages, he finds them all blank within. Unsure why this book would be hidden and so well kept to have nothing in it, he passes it off to me.

>I am able to find a magical tome what appears to be an empty to others.
>
>Hwon hands me what seems to be an interesting tome. He mentions it contains nothing inside, but its exterior is amazingly well kept and designed. As I flip through it to the front of the tome, I land at the "title page", blank as I and the others look over its pages. However, as I stare at the page, a word slowly appears on the page. "Knowledge", takes shape upon the blank page and shortly after that, the author's name, Ovras de Konyll, the author of the mysterious spellbook I carry and have slowly been decrypting. I flip back into the tome and find the first few pages now contain the same coding and ciphers from my spellbook. More work I need to do, and more parchment and quill to decipher its contents. No one else notices these words or filled pages, so I know this book surely contains even more useful knowledge than I've previously had.

>We sneak the book out of the library, after I distract the librarian with my great intellect.
>
>My mind is a race and I cannot focus on anything else in the hidden any longer. I make my way back out and head over to the study tables to begin casting a magical detection ritual, in hopes I can find the true nature of this book now and possibly any others within the room and more importantly, to determine if there are any magical enchantments to detect books leaving the library. The rest of the party also leaves the hidden room, closing it back up as we found it. Hwon decides to test my worries of books leaving the library, and moves ahead to take a book out. I must have this book with me to study it without harassment. I must sneak it out of the library without the librarian taking notice. Hwon seems to leave without a fuss so the rest of us follow. As I am about to step out, the librarian calls out to me, asking if I had found what I needed. I am able to ramble for a few minutes, mainly about my expectations of libraries, organization, and even my own publications enough, that the librarian loses interest and allows us to leave.

>After an afternoon at the library, we call it a night and plan to head out for the goblin stronghold in the morning.
>
>I spent a majority of the night trying to decipher the first few pages of this new tome. Using the current spellbook as a guide, I am able to decipher two additional arcane rituals, and spend the time learning their casting for our upcoming trials. The party spends time having a good meal, collecting up some supplies, and then getting a good rest. Our plan is to head south in the morning, and investigate the blacksmith's, Mertin, missing/dead son by the hands of goblins. It could be a dangerous trip, as we don't know what we are getting into or how many goblins are in the area.

>After breakfast, we make our way through the graveyard, which is closed and in disrepair.
>
>We have a hearty breakfast, knowing this might be our last good meal for the next few days, depending how far out we must journey. I make note of the new knowledge I have gained from last night's study, new arcane magic to holster. We collect our things from our rooms, as I cast one last Alarm spell in Ondros and my room, a nice little present for the next renter, if they show up within the next 8 hours. A blaring alarm to startle them. We make our way to the south gate of town, taking a short cut through the graveyard there. However, there is a sign notifying that the graveyard has been closed, as it looks in disrepair. We feel almost like eyes are on us as we journey through the graveyard, and notice it has been unkept for quite some time. Perhaps something we can investigate further once we return, or simply ask the townsfolk more about.

>Just prior to noon, Archimedes spots a trio of goblins riding wolves ahead of us.
>
>We have been traveling for the whole morning, keeping an eye out for any movement around us. I use Archimedes, who returned in the morning finally, without being able to find where the orcs ended up. Just traveling east for a day, then returning back after another day of travel. As we make our way through some rolling grasslands, Archimedes spots a group of three goblins, riding atop wolves, crossing our path ahead. It appears they have come from the southwest roughly, and are making their way northeast. Suddenly they stop, and it appears the wolves have picked up our scent and are now making their way toward us. We wait for them to get in range and then quickly attempt to take out the wolves from under the goblins. Some of us take damage, others are able to dodge out of the way. The goblins get crafty and attempt to hide from as in the grass as they attack, once their wolves have been dispatched. However, we are able to finish two of them off and Ondros knocks out the last of them.

>After the battle with the goblins, we take a moment to collect ourselves before deciding what to do next.
>
>No one seems to be hurt too badly. Ondros and I were able to assist the others greatly with our arcane powers, putting one goblin to sleep momentarily, and marking the others with a flash of purple light making them easier to see. We make sure everyone is okay, then we take out some rope to tie up the third goblin, as to interrogate him for knowledge on their hideout and anything else which could be of possible use to us in avoiding a full out confrontation with the entire goblin tribe. We must take some time to plan our entrance into their territory and make sure we keep ourselves safe and as hidden as possible.
