# Don't Poke That

>After cleaning up the zombies, Hwon accidentally slams open a door finding a grizzly scene.
>
>Inside is a complete mess of bodily remains, stains, and basically just a mess of guts everywhere. Thank goodness I didn't just eat, because it probably would've came right back up. Even the most battle hardened man would probably have choked up in that room. As bad as the room looks, there isn't even anything of interest in it, which seemed odd.

>We find a room with a large padlock on the exterior, hearing growling noises inside.
>
>We are unable to see anything in the room and the growling is extremely creepy. The padlock on the outside appears to require a very large key, which makes this room even more suspicious. Whatever is locked inside must be some kind of beast given the size of the lock and door. It is quite clear we don't want to mess with whatever is inside. We decide it's best to move on without messing with the lock or what is behind it.

>We fight a few groups of undead as we continue looking through the numerous rooms down here.
>
>We try door after door, looking for a way out of this maze of tombs. We run into a couple groups of undead as we do, but we are able to make quick work of them. But the maze of doorways just doesn't seem to end. Perhaps we will end up like the rest of the bodies down here, lost and dead. Maybe the map to this place was simply a trap to lure others in to die. This might just be the end.

>While taking a short break to rest up, I determine the gold ring we found is non-magical, but the cloak we found earlier is magical.
>
>We take a little break, to try to recover a little bit from this mess of bodies, and maze of tunnels and rooms. Since I have handled things very well so far, I instead take this time to try to identify the objects we have collected so far. Hopefully, one or more of them will provide us some kind of magical assistance. And probably another chapter in my upcoming book, if they are magical.

>In one of the rooms we find what looks to be an alter, giving off a magical glow. Ondross hits it twice with flame and the glow fades.
>
>After taking a quick rest, we continue on searching through the rooms. One of them contains an alter, setup for some kind of ritual. As I approach, finding some kind of magical aura eminating from the alter, Ondross lets loose another flame upon it. Every feels a wave of pain come over them, as we all take a hit. Ondross follows it up with another flame, and destroys whatever was there. It is unfortunate, as I can no longer study whatever was giving off the aura. A bit too hasty of a move in my opinion. It's hard to study ashes.

>In another room, with a large sarcophagus, with find it nameplated with "Sampson", and behind some curtains are large claw marks.
>
>This is very off putting. Ondross had launched another flame into the room, which burned away some of the curtains showing off the claw marks. It seems whatever was in this room at one time, was some monsterous beast. Perhaps Ondross did well, finding these marks, but the curtains he burnt, they probably could have fetched us a good deal of money. At least before they got burnt. Too bad. However, I wonder if what was in this room, is now what is locked behind the padlock. Maybe that is where this Sampson went to.

>As we continue searching the rooms, one has the remains of a skeleton, which Ondross once again hits with his flame, poisoning me.
>
>We continue on, and once again Ondross does not hesitate to launch a flame at a body within one of the rooms. Unfortunately for me, this one goes up in flame, and results in a cloud of poison, which catches me off guard, as I was hoping to investigate the body. I immediately begin coughing, knowing whatever I just breathed in, is now pumping through my blood. I sure hope I can withstand whatever this is. But if not, there seem to be plenty of empty coffins around.

>While Hwon is checking yet another door, he triggers a trap, and I get double poisoned, it's so bad!
>
>As I stuggle to keep up with the group, poisoned and all, we keep moving through the catacombs. Hwon ends up setting off a trapped door, and now everyone gets poisoned by this one. Worse for me, I end up being double poisoned, and am now coughing very heavily, trying to keep myself upright and moving. And I had thought things couldn't get any worse yet. I had done so well, keeping myself in one piece, maybe this is what will end up getting me though.

>We find a large chest, which upon further inspection is super duper trapped.
>
>Hwon is able to notice the chest has some kind of trap rigged, however, I notice it is giving off a magical aura. Whatever is inside appears to be of great value. After further inspection, it appears the only way we can safely open it is to use a large key to unlock it. Which is even more intesting because it appears to be the same size and shape as the large padlock on the "growling room" we found earlier. Not the kind of coincidence I like to find.

>In another room, we find a green glow eminating from a corner, which after getting trapped in, Ondross pokes.
>
>As Ondross pokes the green blob in the corner, just as I'm trying to safely inspect it, he passes right out. That's when things go from bad to worse. The rooms starts to quake, Marrel and I, also stuck in the room, see large groups of insects and spiders pour out of the ground. Things begin to fade to black, as this might just be the end of us. If only I was able to stop Ondross from poking the beast (blob).
